## Bouncy Mushrooms

Server plugin and client mod that makes players able to bounce on large mushrooms!

### Features:
- Landing on a large mushroom will cancel out any fall damage.
- Sneaking will prevent you from bouncing.

### Roadmap:
- Admin commands:
  - Toggle bouncing
  - Toggle mob bouncing
- Server configuration:
  - Delay before task repeats
